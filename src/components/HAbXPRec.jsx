        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I first got into design when I studied at Arizona State University, where I studied Graphic Information Technology. From there, I got a taste of web design and development, which led me to pursue a career in front-end design. Over the years, my passion towards design has evolved to focus on data driven decisions and understanding the impact it has.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion right now is to collect data and uncover insights through data visualization. I want to help capture, organize, and present data in a way that is easy to understand and actionable. My adaptability allows me to thrive in dynamic environments, continuously learning and evolving to meet the demands of the ever-changing data landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my day-to-day work, I love to catch up on the latest AI news and trends, continue learning the technologies of Data Analysis, and work on personal projects that challenge my skills and creativity. I also enjoy keeping my knowledge sharp with building projects and understanding different ways on how to build with different tools.
